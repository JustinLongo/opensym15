#Findings
###  * _Cases_ of collaborative document writing in GitHub _are rare_.
###  * _"Because it's there"_: primary text-based purpose is to post materials to GitHub, with passive consumption and few contributions (e.g., cases 4, 5). 
###  * Very _steep learning curve_ that limits contributions; difficult for new, non-technical users to learn; not well suited for text-based collaborations (e.g., case 7). 
###  * _Stewardship_ is vital; requires guidance from core _leadership_ team (e.g., cases 1, 2)
###  * Requires an _active contributor group_ to maintain momentum (e.g., cases 2, 6)
###  * _Topic_ under consideration must be _conducive_ to both the process and the platform (e.g., cases 1, 2, 6).
###  * Requires _principles_ to guide participation and process (e.g., cases 1, 2, 3, 6, 7)
###  * Needs a _clear incentive structure_ in order to promote group sustainability and individual contributions (e.g., cases 1, 2, 7). 
###  * _Approach_ to distributed workflows - centralized, integration manager, and Dictator and Lieutenants - has profound _implications_ for quality, volume and sustainability of contributions (e.g., cases 1, 2, 7). 
###  * _Process_ for managing changes is crucial with asynchronous edits; editors require _decision-making guidelines_ to merge conflicts (e.g., case 7). 
###  * No _automated ways of evaluating contributions_ in cases studied.
