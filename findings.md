#Findings
###  * Cases of collaborative document writing in GitHub are rare.
###  * "Because it's there": primary text-based purpose is to post materials to GitHub, with passive consumption and few contributions (e.g., cases 4, 5). 
###  * Very steep learning curve that limits contributions; difficult for new, non-technical users to learn; not well suited for text-based collaborations (e.g., case 7). 
###  * Stewardship is vital; requires guidance from core leadership team (e.g., cases 1, 2)
###  * Requires an active contributor group to maintain momentum (e.g., cases 2, 6)
###  * Requires principles to guide participation and process (e.g., cases 1, 2, 3, 6, 7)
###  * Needs a clear incentive structure in order to promote group sustainability and individual contributions (e.g., cases 1, 2, 7). 
###  * Approach to distributed workflows - centralized, integration manager, and Dictator and Lieutenants - has profound implications for quality, volume and sustainability of contributions (e.g., cases 1, 2, 7). 
###  * Process for managing changes is crucial with asynchronous edits; editors require decision-making guidelines to merge conflicts (e.g., case 7). 
###  * No automated ways of evaluating contributions in cases studied.
###  * Topic under consideration must be conducive to both the process and the platform (e.g., cases 1, 2, 6).
